# ðŸ“„ Dart-App Project
Mobile development project to start in Flutter/Dart

## :link: Settings
To run this algorithm, you must have an IDE, Flutter and Dart installed

If you have already installed them, check using the terminal and entering flutter --version for Flutter:
```
Flutter 3.16.9 â€¢ channel stable â€¢ https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
Framework â€¢ revision 41456452f2 (13 days ago) â€¢ 2024-01-25 10:06:23 -0800

```
And the chocolatey --version:
```
2.2.2
```
## :link: Method used
To develop the application, the following steps were used:

> Configuring IDE

Using Visual Studio Code through the programs and extensions that configure Flutter and Dart

> Debugging

Through the developer settings on Android, USB Debug was allowed at all levels

> Chocolatey

For operational reasons, the development parallel was done by Debug USB instead of simulators, using scrCpy. In Powershell:
```
choco install scrcpy
```
```
choco install adb
````
With this, it is possible to mirror and move the cell phone screen on the notebook

> By conclusion

Just run and debug and synchronized development
